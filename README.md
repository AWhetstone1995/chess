# H3 **Ruby Chess - TOP**

This is a command line chess game through The Odin Project Curriculum, showcasing a fully functional chess game with captures, legal movement validation, check and mate validation, game draw checking and special move implementation.

This project is an encapuslation of OOP principles while sticking to as cleanly written code as possible. This implements several object class structures, class inheritance and public/private variable and method separation.

As of 10/09/2021, most core functionalities of chess are implemented, and it is possible for two players to play a game of chess.

To Do:

> Special Move Implementation (Castling, En Passant, Promotion)  
> Stalemate and impossible check validation  
> Pretty up the board display to display legal moves and captures
